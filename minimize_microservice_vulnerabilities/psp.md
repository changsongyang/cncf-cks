## What is a PSP?
- Controls what security-related configurations pods are allowed to run in the cluster.
- Enforces desired Pod security configuration with the cluster.

Primary need for PSP is to prevent running insecure and misconfigured Pod in the cluster, as that can put cluster or other workloads at risk.
